		<h1 class="contentheader">The BIG 3</h1>
		<br/>

		<p>This page is a short introduction to <em>The Big 3</em>, which earn their rank amongst the most rewarding exercises
			for a number of reasons. When performing any exercise, listed on this page or not, it is key that you utilise
			<strong>proper</strong> form. As a general rule of thumb, you should always
			<em>"stand proud"</em> with your chest out, shoulders back and your (lower) back straight! Stances and grips
			vary, but shoulder-width is often applicable or at least viable - but you should always research new exercise.</p>

			<p style="color:#19B5FE"><b>So, what are the benefits of the so-called "Big 3":</b>
			</p>

			<ul class="list">
				<li><b>Compound movements:</b> This means they are multi-joint exercises and that performing these movements (<strong>CORRECTLY</strong>)
					utilises the entire body. Any workout should be based around one of these major compound movements.</li>

				<br/>
				<li><b>Strength:</b> Stimulating the entire body in this way promotes "all kinds of gains"; from strength, size
					and a better function CNS (central nervous system), to the release of naturally occurring hormones. This leads
					to better performing body in all aspects of day to day life, and can actually <b>improve</b> the longevity
					of your joints and such.</li>

				<br/>
				<li><b>Skill:</b> People mistake weightlifters as meatheads with more muscle than brain cells, but like any sport,
					there is a level of skill and dedication required to achieve results. If performed incorrectly, the big 3
					can set you up for permanent injury; if performed skilfully, you will look like a badass and discover a myriad
					of benefits.</li>

				<br/>
				<li><b>Bragging Rights...:</b> Competition is healthy! And if you can <i>deadlift a car</i>, who isn't going to
					be impressed!</li>
			</ul>

			<h4><a style="color:#19B5FE" href="http://www.bodybuilding.com/exercises/detail/view/name/barbell-bench-press-medium-griphttp://www.bodybuilding.com/exercises/detail/view/name/barbell-bench-press-medium-grip">
			<u>The Bench Press</u></a></h4><img class="image right" src="Resources/bench.jpg" alt="Barbell Bench Press" align="right" /><br/>

			<p>The bench press is typically a favourite in the gym, and the first call of order when it comes to bragging rights.
				And rightly so - as one of <em>The Big 3</em>, the bench press is a feat of strength and should be incorporated
				into your workout no matter what your goal, and plays a major role in upper-body development. As with any compound
				movement, the bench requires full-body recruitment and as such should be performed cautiously - that is unless
				you want to snap up your shoulders, back, elbows <b>AND</b> chest, all in one go! Proper form should <strong>always</strong>				be a priority, and a training partner is advised both for feedback and tricky situations (it's cool to lift
				two times your body weight but it isn't cool to get squashed by it...).</p>
			<br/>

			<h4><a style="color:#19B5FE" href="http://www.bodybuilding.com/exercises/detail/view/name/barbell-full-squathttp://www.bodybuilding.com/exercises/detail/view/name/barbell-full-squat">
			<u>The Squat</u></a></h4><img class="image left" src="Resources/squat.jpg" alt="Barbell Back-Squat" align="left" /><br/>

			<p>The squat is even bigger than the bench press, although you've probably heard all the jokes about <em>leg day.</em>				With a fear of getting squashed and pain for days to come, legs are the first thing people try to skip. What
				they might not know, or choose to ignore, are the benefits that a strong pair of legs and a good squat reap.
				As well as triggering the release of growth hormones - (<i>you heard right - <b>squatting helps your upper-body grow!</b>)</i>				- big, strong legs are the foundation of any aesthetic and healthy physique. If you <strong>don't</strong>				squat then you're missing out on big performance gains! Again, proper form is key in maintaining healthy elbows,
				knees and posture - follow a structured routine and prioritise form over everything!</p>

			<u>The Deadlift</u></a></h4><img class="image right" src="Resources/deadlift.jpg" alt="Barbell Deadlift" align="right" /><br/>

			<p><strong>The deadlift.</strong> The big, bad boss of the big 3, and <u><strong>ALL</strong></u> the lifts. It
				even sounds menacing, right? In fact, the "dead" part of deadlift simply describes lifting the weight from
				the floor - i.e. a <em>dead</em> weight. It is, however, any strongman or powerlifter's biggest lift, with pros
				like
				<a style="color:#19B5FE" href="https://www.google.co.uk/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&amp;ion=1&amp;espv=2&amp;ie=UTF-8#q=eddie+hall+deadlift+record">
					<u>Eddie Hall</u>
				</a> lifting - <strong>insane</strong> - amounts. They are the embodiment of strength and the purest form of
				compound movement;considered as a genuine full-body movement - recruiting every single fibre and ounce of mental-grit
				in your body. For these reasons, most people require more recovery time after a deadlift session. It taxes
				the CNS heavily, and whilst this is great the strength, size and refining motor-patterns, overdoing it can
				quickly bring about debilitating problems in the legs and lower back.</p>
